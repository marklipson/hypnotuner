hypnotuner
==========

Experimental meditation tone generator


Main coding TODOs:
* HypnoTuner class has both tone generation and UI - split them apart
* Make it pretty


Libraries:

* lib/jfugue.jar really has nothing to do with this system yet but it is a
  cool library.  It is only used in the MusicServlet class which was a
  partially formed idea with some collaborative music site in mind.  Or
  maybe a proof of concept.  I don't remember.  Anyway, it isn't used in
  HypnoTuner yet.

* "vorbis" folder comes from http://www.vorbis.com/.  The intention was
  to generate ".ogg" files that play on their own.  The code to do this is
  quite a ways from being ready though.
